A program will be written to do inverse kinematic calculations for my system between two points.
Then, a program will be written to convert the path, generated in the pattern-to-path code, into readable coordinate txt documents.
Then, it will convert that long list of coordinates into movement, based on a specific sampling rate, via the motors connected to the arduino.
