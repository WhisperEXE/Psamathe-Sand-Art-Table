A smaller section about refining my work with Tkinter and making things looks better. 
Previously I used Tkinter to sinply make it eaiser to test things, but now I am trying to use it to develop an actual UI.
This way, users can see their patterns being generated in real time and can see what the progress has been on their art table.
They will be allowed to pause and resume as well was run a wipe program.
