A basic set of files that helped in calibrating the motor's movements, reactions with the mechanical model and the error handling
The idea for the error handling was based on trial and error mixed with mathematics using gear ratios. 
The other programs will be arduino based but if I have time, I will include the GUI for the error checking trial and error with maths software.
